===============

What is it
----------
`plot_growth_graphs.py` is a python script that plots the exported data from the BabyTracker android application on top
of the child's development graphs provided by the [World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards](http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm).

Main features
-------------

The script, using as input data the file exported from the Baby Tracker app (of type *.abt)  
generates a series plots showing:
 * the curve and rate of child's growth, and
 * in which [percentile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of population the child lies.

An example of the output plots is shown in [this figure](http://github.com/dqsis/child-growth-charts/blob/master/data/growth.png).
